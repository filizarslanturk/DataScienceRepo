The company\\'s flagship Model 3 is the best-selling EV model in the United States. Tesla, which has managed to garner the reputation of a gold standard over the years, is now a far bigger entity that what it started off since its IPO in 2010, with its market cap crossing $1 trillion for the first time in October 2021.? The EV king\\'s market capitalization is more than the combined value of legacy automakers including Toyota, Volkswagen, Daimler, General Motors and Ford.Over the years, Tesla has shifted from developing niche products for affluent buyers to making more affordable EVs for the masses. The firm\\'s three-pronged business model approach of direct sales, servicing, and charging its EVs sets it apart from other carmakers. Tesla, which is touted as the clean energy revolutionary automaker, is much more than just a car manufacturer.</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  </td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  </tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</tbody>\\n\\t\\t\\t  </table>\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t<div style=\"background-color:#fff;
